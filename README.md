# LeapYear

This app lets the user know if the entered year is a leap year or not. It accepts the user entry in landing screen (i.e. LYMainViewController). 
Various checks are applied to validate the user provided data i.e. it should be four digit numeric value greater than 1582 (because Gregorian calendar was defined in 1582). 
If the provided data is not valid, it displays message to enter valid data otherwise various calculations are performed on it, according to acceptance criteria, to check if it is a leap year or not. Depending upon the result, appropriate message is displayed to user.
